for each node n in the graph
    n.distance = infinity

create empty list

start.distance = 0, add start to list

while list not empty
    current = node in the list with the smallest distance, remove current from list
    for each node n that is adjacent to current
        if n.distance > current.distance + length of edge from n to current
            n.distance = current.distance + length of edge from n to current
            n.parent = current
            add n to back of the list if there isnâ€™t already
