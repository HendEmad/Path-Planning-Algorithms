for each node n in the graph:
    n.distance = infinity

create empty list

goal.distance = 0, add goal to list

while list not empty
    current = first node in list, remove current from list
        for each node n that is adjacent to current
            if n.distance = infinity
                n.distance = current.distance + 1
                add n to back of the list
